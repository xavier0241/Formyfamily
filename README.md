I want to learn different coding methods, critical thinking, and solving because I love it and my family too.
I was a College who took Hotel, Restaurant and Management and dropped it because I realized I don't like what I've been doing in my course.
So I stop going to College for one semester and then I realized that coding is my thing. Based on how I realized how awesome it is and educational.
But I still neeed to go through a lot of hard work, stress in order to atleast master codes and I think I feel I'm in a right website to do this things. I'm very thankful you made site, Mr. whoeveryouare.
I'm taking up Information Technlogy course now and ever since I am learning about coding it makes me want to code more but what like I've said I still need a guidancce for I am still a beginner. Thank you.
